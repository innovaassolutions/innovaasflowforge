This is a **great example** to test whether your offering is truly flexible — and the short answer is:

> **Yes, this consultant could absolutely use the tool — but they should *not* be forced into an existing category like “general business ops.”**
> They deserve a **distinct category**, even if it shares the same underlying engine.

Let me explain cleanly.

---

## What Kind of Consultant Is This, Really?

This person is **not**:

* A process optimizer
* A traditional management consultant
* A compliance or systems person

They are a **Human Systems & Organisational Transformation consultant**, grounded in:

* Organisational Development (OD)
* Psychology & psychodynamics
* Culture, leadership, emotion, and meaning
* Systemic change (not just efficiency)

Their *unit of value* is:

> **Insight into human dynamics that block or enable change**

---

## Can They Use an Interviewer Agent?

**Yes — exceptionally well.**
In fact, this profile is *one of your strongest potential users*.

Why?

Because interviewer agents:

* Externalise reflective inquiry
* Surface hidden assumptions
* Reveal contradictions between espoused values and lived behaviour
* Create psychological safety at scale (when designed correctly)

This aligns *perfectly* with their work.

---

## Why They Don’t Fit Cleanly Into Existing Categories

Let’s test them against your current verticals:

### ❌ Pharma / Med Device

Too technical, compliance-heavy.

### ❌ General Business Process Optimisation

Too transactional, efficiency-focused.

### ❌ Education

Some overlap, but still not the core.

What’s missing is a category focused on:

* Culture
* Leadership
* Human dynamics
* Sensemaking
* Readiness for change

---

## The Right Category:

### **Organisational & Leadership Intelligence**

(or similar language)

You are not creating a new *engine* — just a new **interpretive lens**.

---

## Suggested Vertical Offering for This Persona

### Product Name (example)

**Organisational Insight & Change Readiness Intelligence™**

### Buyer / User

* OD consultants
* Executive coaches
* Leadership facilitators
* Culture transformation practitioners
* ESG / B Corp advisors

---

## What the Interviewer Agent Does *Differently* Here

This is important.

The agent is **not interrogative** in the consulting sense.
It is **reflective, pattern-seeking, and sensemaking-oriented**.

### It interviews:

* Leaders
* Teams
* Cross-functional groups
* Stakeholders in tension

### It surfaces:

* Defensive routines
* Emotional undercurrents
* Role confusion
* Authority and accountability gaps
* Espoused vs enacted values
* Adaptive vs technical challenges

This is *gold* for OD work.

---

## Outputs That Matter to *This* Consultant

Not:

* Automation backlogs
* ROI spreadsheets

But:

* Cultural pattern maps
* Leadership tension themes
* Change readiness indicators
* Psychological safety signals
* Narrative summaries leaders can *actually hear*
* Hypotheses for intervention

This becomes **pre-work and sensemaking** before:

* Group coaching
* Leadership intensives
* Systemic interventions
* Multi-stakeholder simulations

---

## Pricing Model for This Category

This persona will *not* respond well to “AI tool” pricing.

### Best fit:

**Practitioner Enablement Pricing**

Examples:

* $3k–$6k per client engagement
* $1k–$2k/month practitioner subscription
* White-labelled use inside their own consulting offer

They then embed your tool into:

> “My reflective discovery and systemic diagnosis phase”

You become **their force multiplier**, not their replacement.

---

## Strategic Insight (Very Important)

> **This consultant is not your end customer — they are a channel.**

They already:

* Have trust
* Speak the right language
* Sell high-value engagements
* Struggle to scale themselves

Your tool:

* Extends their reflective capacity
* Increases consistency
* Captures insight they can’t always hold alone

That’s extremely powerful.

---

## How to Think About Categories Going Forward

You don’t need endless verticals.

You need **3–4 archetypes**:

1. **Operational / Technical Discovery**
   (manufacturing, systems, compliance)

2. **Process & Decision Optimisation**
   (business ops, PE, efficiency)

3. **Human Systems & Change Intelligence**
   (OD, leadership, culture, ESG)

Same core platform.
Different question trees.
Different language.
Different outputs.

---

## Bottom Line

* ✅ Yes, they should use the tool
* ❌ No, don’t force them into “general business”
* ✅ Give them a **Human Systems / OD category**
* ✅ Treat them as **power users and multipliers**

If you want, next I can:

* Design a **question tree aligned to psychodynamic OD work**
* Help you position this as **“AI-assisted sensemaking”**
* Draft a **co-brand / white-label pitch** for consultants like this

Just tell me which direction you want to go.
