An **interviewer agent** is an AI agent whose *job is not to give answers*, but to **extract high-quality information from humans**.

Think of it as the AI equivalent of a *great consultant, journalist, or discovery lead*.

---

## The Core Purpose

> **To systematically uncover what people know, assume, want, and forget to say — and turn that into structured, usable knowledge.**

Humans rarely volunteer the *right* information on their own. An interviewer agent fixes that.

## What an Interviewer Agent Actually Does

### 1. Drives Discovery (Not Q&A)

Instead of:

> “Tell me about your system.”

It asks:

* “Who owns this system?”
* “What breaks first when demand spikes?”
* “What do you still track in spreadsheets?”
* “What decision do you *avoid* because data is unreliable?”

It **leads** the conversation.

---

### 2. Detects Gaps, Ambiguity, and Hand-Waving

When someone says:

> “It’s mostly automated.”

The agent follows up:

* “What exactly is manual?”
* “How often does a human intervene?”
* “What happens when that person is not available?”

This is where real insight lives.

### 3. Adapts Questions in Real Time

Unlike static forms, it:

* Changes depth based on confidence
* Skips irrelevant branches
* Goes deeper when contradictions appear

This mirrors how senior consultants work in workshops.

---

### 4. Converts Conversation → Structured Output

Behind the scenes, it’s mapping answers into:

* Process steps
* Systems inventory
* Data sources
* Pain points
* Risks
* Opportunities
* Assumptions

So the output isn’t a transcript — it’s a **usable model of reality**.

---

## What It’s Commonly Used For

### 1. Discovery Workshops (Consulting)

* Digital transformation
* ERP / MES / data platform assessments
* AI readiness evaluations

👉 This directly overlaps with your **manufacturing audits and SAP visibility work**.

---

### 2. Requirements Gathering (Software & Data)

* What users *actually* do vs. what’s documented
* Edge cases engineers never hear about
* Implicit rules (“we always do it this way”)

---

### 3. Organizational Knowledge Capture

* Institutional memory before people leave
* Tribal knowledge on the shop floor
* “How things really work”

Critical in small factories like the aluminum-cutting client you described.

---

### 4. Post-Mortems & Root Cause Analysis

Instead of blaming:

* “Walk me through what you noticed first”
* “What signal was ignored?”
* “What workaround existed?”

This pairs well with predictive maintenance insights.

---

## Why It’s Valuable (The Non-Obvious Part)

### Humans Are Bad at:

* Being complete
* Being precise
* Remembering exceptions
* Articulating tacit knowledge

### Interviewer Agents Are Good at:

* Patience
* Consistency
* Following logical branches
* Asking uncomfortable but necessary questions

## How It Fits Into a Multi-Agent System

A typical setup:

1. **Interviewer Agent**
   Extracts raw truth from humans

2. **Analyst Agent**
   Identifies patterns, gaps, and contradictions

3. **Critic Agent**
   Challenges assumptions and rosy narratives

4. **Report Writer Agent**
   Produces McKinsey-style output (which you care about)

Each agent has a *different objective*, reducing blind spots.

---

## What It Is *Not*

* Not a chatbot
* Not a survey
* Not a passive note-taker
* Not “ask anything you want”

It is **goal-driven interrogation**, done politely.

---

## Strategic Insight (Important)

> **Most transformation projects fail not because of bad tech — but because discovery was shallow.**

An interviewer agent:

* Scales senior-level discovery
* Removes dependency on a few experts
* Creates repeatability (huge consulting advantage)

This is why it’s such a strong foundation for what you’re building.

* Design an **interviewer agent prompt architecture**
* Show **question trees for manufacturing / digital transformation**
* Explain how to **price interviewer agents as a product**

Just say the word.
