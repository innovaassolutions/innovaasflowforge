## Design Principles

### Trust-First Questioning

Every question must respect the trust architecture established in stakeholder communications:

1. **Pattern-focused, not person-focused** — "How do things work here?" not "Who is responsible?"
2. **Observational, not accusatory** — "What have you noticed?" not "What's wrong?"
3. **Experience-based, not judgment-based** — "What's your experience?" not "Do you think X is good?"
4. **Open-ended exploration** — Allow unexpected insights to emerge

### AI Facilitation Approach

The AI interviewer should:
- Build rapport before depth
- Follow threads that emerge organically
- Avoid leading questions
- Probe gently on signals of strain
- Never push for identification of individuals

## Module 1: Student Wellbeing & Academic Life

### Target Participants
Students (age-appropriate sample, typically Year 7+)

### Opening / Rapport Building

```
"Hi! Thanks for taking the time to chat with me today.

Before we start, I want you to know: this conversation is completely anonymous.
Your teachers can't see what you say. Your name isn't attached to any of this.
I'm just here to understand what school is actually like for you.

There are no right or wrong answers. I'm curious about your real experience.

Ready to start?"
```

### Core Question Areas

#### 1. Daily Experience

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| "Walk me through a typical day at school. What's it actually like?" | Baseline, comfort building |
| "What parts of the day do you look forward to? What parts do you dread?" | Emotional landscape |
| "Where in the school do you feel most comfortable? Least comfortable?" | Safety/belonging signals |

#### 2. Academic Life

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| "How would you describe the pressure around academics here?" | Stress detection |
| "When you're struggling with something, what do you do? Who do you go to?" | Support systems |
| "What's the attitude toward making mistakes here? Is it okay to fail?" | Learning culture |

#### 3. Relationships

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| "How would you describe the vibe between students in your year?" | Peer dynamics |
| "Do you feel like teachers actually know you? Like, beyond just in class?" | Connection quality |
| "If something was bothering you at school, would you feel comfortable telling an adult?" | Trust in pastoral care |

#### 4. Wellbeing Signals

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| "On a scale of 1-10, how supported do you feel at this school?" | Quantitative anchor |
| "What would make that number higher?" | Improvement signals |
| "Is there anything about school that you think adults don't really understand?" | Hidden patterns |

#### 5. Open Exploration

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| "If you could change one thing about this school, what would it be?" | Priority signal |
| "Is there anything else you want to share that I haven't asked about?" | Catch emerging themes |

### Safeguarding Sensitivity

If student indicates distress, harm, or safety concerns:

```
"Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like that's been really difficult.

I want to make sure you know: if you're feeling unsafe or need someone to talk to,
the school's pastoral team is there to help.

Would you like me to let someone know you might want to talk?"
```

If explicit self-harm or harm to others indicators:
→ Trigger break-glass protocol (see technical-anonymity-architecture.md)

---

## Module 2: Teaching & Learning Experience

### Target Participants
Teachers (sample across divisions/departments)

### Opening / Rapport Building

```
"Thanks for taking the time to participate.

Before we begin: this conversation is anonymised. Leadership sees patterns, not individuals.
Your responses aren't linked to your name, and nothing here affects your position.

We're looking for structural patterns — where systems work and where they strain.
This isn't about evaluating anyone. It's about understanding the terrain.

Sound okay?"
```

### Core Question Areas

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| "Walk me through a typical week. Where does your time actually go?" | Workload reality |

#### 2. Support Systems

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| "When you need support — professionally or personally — where do you find it here?" | Support infrastructure |
| "How would you describe the relationship between teachers and leadership?" | Vertical trust |

|----------|---------|
| "What's your sense of how students are really doing — beyond the surface?" | Teacher-observed signals |
| "Are there patterns you see in students that you don't think leadership is aware of?" | Hidden student strain |
| "What do students tell you that they probably don't tell anyone else?" | Canary signals |

#### 5. Sustainability

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| "On a scale of 1-10, how sustainable is your current workload?" | Quantitative anchor |
| "What would make that number higher?" | Improvement signals |
| "Looking ahead to next term, how are you feeling about it?" | Forward sentiment |

#### 6. Open Exploration

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| "If leadership could understand one thing they don't currently see, what would it be?" | Gap identification |
| "Is there anything else on your mind that I haven't asked about?" | Catch emerging themes |

## Module 3: Parent Confidence & Trust

### Target Participants
Parents (sample across year groups)

### Opening / Rapport Building

```
"Thank you for taking the time to participate.

This conversation is completely anonymous. Your responses aren't linked to your name
or your child. We're looking for patterns in parent experience, not individual opinions.

We're interested in your honest observations — not endorsements.
The school is trying to understand how things are landing, not collect testimonials.

Does that make sense?"
```

### Core Question Areas

#### 1. Confidence & Trust

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| "How would you describe your overall confidence in the school right now?" | Baseline sentiment |
| "Has that confidence changed over time? In what direction?" | Trajectory signal |
| "What would strengthen your confidence? What might weaken it?" | Levers |

#### 2. Communication

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| "How well do you feel the school communicates with you?" | Communication quality |
| "When you have a concern, how easy is it to raise it? And does anything happen?" | Responsiveness |
| "Do you feel like you understand what's going on at the school?" | Transparency |

#### 3. Child's Experience (Parent Lens)

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| "How does your child talk about school at home?" | Indirect wellbeing signal |
| "What does your child love about school? What do they struggle with?" | Child experience via parent |
| "Are there things your child tells you that you don't think the school knows about?" | Hidden signals |

#### 4. Stability & Continuity

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| "On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend this school to a close friend?" | NPS-style signal |
| "What would make that number higher?" | Improvement signals |
| "Are there things you're watching that would affect your family's commitment to the school?" | Early warning signals |

#### 6. Open Exploration

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| "If you could tell the school leadership one thing they might not be seeing, what would it be?" | Blind spot identification |
| "Is there anything else you'd like to share?" | Catch emerging themes |

## Cross-Module Analysis Points

### Triangulation Questions

These topics should be explored with all three groups to enable triangulation:

| Topic | Student Version | Teacher Version | Parent Version |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Safety/Belonging | "Do you feel safe here?" | "How would you describe student safety and belonging?" | "How safe does your child feel at school?" |
| Communication | "Do you feel heard by teachers and leaders?" | "Do you feel your voice reaches leadership?" | "Do you feel the school listens to you?" |
| Change/Stability | "Does the school feel stable to you?" | "How stable does the school feel right now?" | "How stable does the school feel to you?" |
| Support | "Who do you go to when you need help?" | "Where do you find support?" | "Does your child know where to find support?" |

### Signal Mapping

| Signal Type | Student Indicator | Teacher Indicator | Parent Indicator |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Trust erosion | "Adults don't understand" | "Voice doesn't reach leadership" | "Not sure what's going on" |
| Strain | Low wellbeing score | Sustainability <6 | Stability concerns |
| Hidden issues | "Things adults don't see" | "Patterns leadership misses" | "What my child tells me" |
| Confidence | Belonging score | Relationship with leadership | NPS score |

## AI Facilitation Guidelines

### Probing Techniques

When a signal emerges, probe gently:

```
"You mentioned [X]. Can you tell me more about that?"

"That's interesting. What makes you say that?"

"I'm curious about that. Can you give me an example?"

"When you say [X], what do you mean exactly?"
```

### Avoiding Leading Questions

| Don't Ask | Do Ask |
|-----------|--------|
| "Do you think the school is too focused on academics?" | "How would you describe the academic culture here?" |
| "Are teachers overworked?" | "How would you describe the workload for teachers?" |
| "Are parents concerned about leadership?" | "How do you feel about the school's direction?" |

### Energy Check

Mid-conversation:

```
"How are you feeling about this conversation so far?
We're about halfway through. Is this okay?"
```

### Closing

```
"Thank you for sharing all of this. Your perspective really matters.

Before we finish — is there anything else on your mind
that I haven't asked about? Anything you want to add?"
```
