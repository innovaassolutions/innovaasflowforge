## Pricing Philosophy

### Why Paid Pilot

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Filters unserious schools | Schools that pay are committed |
| Protects premium positioning | Free pilots commoditize the offering |
| Covers operational cost | Synthesis requires significant effort |
| Sets value expectation | Prepares for annual pricing |

### Why These Price Points

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Premium school context | $30-50k+ annual fees per student |
| Risk compression value | Early warning prevents withdrawals, lawsuits, reputation damage |
| Competitive landscape | Positioned above surveys, below full consulting engagements |
| Relationship investment | Pilot is entry point, not profit center |

## Packaging Options

### Option A: Pilot Only

- 14-day pilot as described
- No commitment beyond
- Conversion conversation at Day 14

### Option B: Pilot + First Year Bundle

- 14-day pilot
- Discounted first-year annual if committed within 30 days
- Example: Pilot ($8k) + Year 1 ($35k → $30k) = $38k total

### Option C: Multi-Year Commitment

- 14-day pilot
- 2-year or 3-year commitment at discounted rate
- Example: 3-year Tier A = $150k (vs. $180k individual years)

## Discounting Guidelines

### When Discounting is Acceptable

| Scenario | Discount Range |
|----------|----------------|
| Reference school (case study rights) | 10-20% |
| Multi-school group | 15-25% |
| Multi-year commitment | 10-15% per year |
| Strategic market entry (new geography) | Up to 30% for first school |

### When to Hold Price

| Scenario | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| "We need to try it first" | Paid pilot IS the trial |
| "Other tools are cheaper" | Different value proposition |
| "Can we start with less?" | Pilot is already minimum viable |
| Price-sensitive negotiation | Protects positioning |
