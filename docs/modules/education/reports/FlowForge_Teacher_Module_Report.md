# FlowForge — Teacher Climate & Lived Experience Module Report  
## Module Report Architecture (Non‑Diluted Founder Spec)

> **This is a Module Report, not a dashboard.**  
> It is designed to surface *how teaching actually feels inside the institution* — safely, anonymously, and without weaponisation.

This is the most sensitive FlowForge report.  
It is also the most predictive.

Schools lose teachers **before** they see it in metrics.  
This report exists to make that loss visible *early*, without fear or blame.

---

## 1️⃣ Purpose of the Teacher Module Report

The Teacher Module Report answers **one question only**:

> **“If I am responsible for staff stability and teaching quality, what do I now see that I didn’t before — and what must I do about it?”**

This report is designed for:
- Head of School  
- Principal  
- Senior Leadership Team  
- HR / People & Culture (read‑only, non‑punitive)  

It is **not** designed for:
- performance management  
- appraisal  
- contract decisions  
- staff circulation  

---

## 🎯 What This Report Must Surface (Non‑Negotiable)

The Teacher Module Report must surface:

- burnout before resignation  
- fear before silence  
- disengagement before performance drop  
- leadership impact before attrition  
- cultural toxicity before open conflict  

Without:
- identifying individuals  
- creating fear  
- triggering defensiveness  
- enabling retaliation  

This report protects teachers **by design**.

## 🧩 Core Structure of the Teacher Module Report

Every Teacher Module Report follows the **same five‑section structure** as all FlowForge modules.

Consistency signals safety.  
Predictability encourages honesty.

---

## 1️⃣ Module Pulse (Orientation, Not Judgment)

**Purpose:**  
To orient leadership to staff climate without provoking threat responses.

### Must include:
- Overall climate level *(Stable → At Risk)*  
- Participation context *(pilot cohort)*  
- Directional insight banner *(not conclusions)*  

### Required language discipline:
Use:
> *Early signal — directional, not evaluative*

Avoid:
- ratings of teachers  
- language that implies blame  
- individual performance framing  

This section answers:
> “How concerned should I be — not who should I look at.”

---

## 2️⃣ The Four Lenses — Reframed for Teacher Reality

The same Four Lenses are used across all modules, but **their meaning here is distinct**.

### Teacher Module Lens Definitions

**What’s Holding**  
→ Conditions helping teachers stay functional and committed

**What’s Slipping**  
→ Strains teachers are absorbing quietly to remain professional

**What’s Misunderstood**  
→ Gaps between leadership assumptions and classroom reality

**What’s At Risk**  
→ Conditions likely to drive attrition, burnout, or withdrawal

This framing:
- validates professionalism  
- surfaces hidden cost  
- avoids moral judgement  

---

## 3️⃣ Evidence Layer — Intra‑Module Teacher Signals Only

This report must show **teacher‑only patterns**.

❌ No triangulation yet  
❌ No comparison to students or parents  
✅ Teacher experience on its own terms  

---

### A. Signal Clusters (Recurring Teacher Realities)

Examples (illustrative):
- Unsustainable workload normalised as “part of the job”  
- Discipline policies inconsistently enforced  
- Parent pressure without leadership backup  
- Micromanagement vs trust tension  
- PD perceived as performative  
- Emotional exhaustion masked by professionalism  

These clusters answer:
> **“What are teachers repeatedly living with, even when coping?”**

---

### B. Optional Micro‑Verbatims (Max 1 per Cluster)

Only include when clarity is sharpened, not sensationalised.

Example:
> “I can handle the teaching. It’s everything around it that’s wearing me down.”

Rules:
- anonymised  
- no incidents  
- no identifying context  

The purpose is **recognition**, not exposure.

---

## 4️⃣ Action Plan — Leadership‑Owned, System‑Owned

Actions must communicate:
> **“We see this — and it is our responsibility.”**

They must **never** feel like:
- teacher remediation  
- resilience training substitution  
- coping advice  

---

### Teacher Climate — Example Action Structure

#### Immediate *(Safety & Authority)*
- Reinforce leadership backing on discipline and parent escalation  
- Clarify expectations around workload boundaries  
- Signal psychological safety for raising concerns  

#### Short‑Term *(Support & Sustainability)*
- Review workload distribution and admin burden  
- Audit timetable equity and duty allocation  
- Align behaviour policies with classroom realities  
- Reassess PD relevance and delivery  

#### Strategic *(Trust & Retention)*
- Establish protected teacher feedback loops  
- Clarify leadership decision‑making transparency  
- Embed teacher trust indicators into retention monitoring  
- Build career pathways that do not require exit  

Each action line must:
- name the lived teacher issue  
- avoid individualisation  
- imply leadership ownership  

---

## 5️⃣ “Why This Matters” — Teacher Module Version

This section answers:

> **“Why should leadership treat this as a stability priority?”**

### Required tone:
- factual  
- grounded  
- non‑dramatic  

### Example:

**Why this matters:**  
Teachers rarely leave abruptly. They disengage quietly first. When trust and sustainability erode, teaching quality and continuity follow — long before resignations appear.

Calm. Accurate. Predictive.

## 🧠 What This Report Must NOT Include (By Design)

This restraint is essential for trust.

🚫 Individual teacher metrics  
🚫 Performance language  
🚫 HR action framing  
🚫 Comparative rankings  
🚫 Emotional labelling  

Those belong **outside** this report — or not at all.

---

## 🧩 How This Report Feeds the System

This Teacher Module Report:
- functions as an **early‑warning system**  
- escalates only via defined governance thresholds  
- protects teacher candour by limiting exposure  

Its value lies in **what it prevents**, not what it reacts to.
