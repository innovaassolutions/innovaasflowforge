# FlowForge — Module Dashboard Architecture (Non‑Diluted Founder Spec)

## 1️⃣ Module Dashboards  
*(Student Wellbeing · Teacher Climate · Parent Experience)*

→ Deep, lived‑reality views  
→ Used by Heads, Principals, Safeguarding, Ops leads  

These dashboards are **not summaries**.  
They are **domain mirrors**.

---

## 🎯 Goal of a MODULE Dashboard (Anchor Principle)

A module dashboard should answer **one question only**:

> **“If I am responsible for this domain, what do I now see that I didn’t before — and what do I do with it?”**

For **Student Wellbeing**, this means the dashboard must surface:

- lived experience  
- hidden friction  
- early stress signals  
- dignity / safety indicators  

**without overwhelming leadership**.

---

## 🧩 What EVERY Module Dashboard Needs (Core Structure)

Each module dashboard follows the **same five‑part structure**, regardless of topic.

You already have pieces of this.  
We are **refining, not rebuilding**.

---

## 1️⃣ Module Pulse (Keep This)

You’ve nailed this visually.

### Keep:
- Urgency gauge (Low → Critical)  
- Session count / participation  
- Primary recommendation banner  

### 🔧 Small but critical upgrade:
Add a **confidence descriptor**, e.g.

> *Early signal — pilot cohort*

This:
- reduces defensiveness  
- prevents over‑interpretation  
- builds trust early  

---

## 2️⃣ The Four Lenses — With MODULE‑SPECIFIC Subtext

Right now, the lenses are generic.  
They need **domain‑specific meaning** beneath them.

### Example: Student Wellbeing

**What’s Holding**  
→ Protective factors supporting student wellbeing  

**What’s Slipping**  
→ Emerging stressors affecting daily experience  

**What’s Misunderstood**  
→ Gaps between adult assumptions and student reality  

**What’s At Risk**  
→ Conditions that may escalate if unaddressed  

This reframes the same structure **without adding UI clutter**, while dramatically improving comprehension.

## 3️⃣ Evidence Layer — MODULE‑SPECIFIC (Not Triangulated Yet)

Key distinction:

❌ Module dashboards should **NOT** show triangulation  
✅ They should show **intra‑module evidence only**

### What to add here (lightweight but powerful):

### A. Signal Clusters (Themes, Not Quotes Yet)

Example:
- Facilities hygiene *(↑ frequency)*  
- Break‑time congestion  
- Academic pressure during exams  
- Comfort asking for help  

This answers:

> **“What themes are repeating within this module?”**

---

### B. Optional Micro‑Verbatims (Max 1 per cluster)

Only when useful.

Example:
> “Toilets are often dirty and don’t have tissues.”

Rules:
- no names  
- no incidents  
- no attribution beyond role / level  

---

## 4️⃣ Action Plan — Rewritten as MODULE‑OWNED Actions

You were exactly right:  
Current short‑term actions are **too generic**.

Each module dashboard must produce actions that feel like:

> **“This is our problem to fix.”**

### Student Wellbeing — Example Structure

#### Immediate *(Safeguarding / Dignity)*
- Follow up on reported hygiene and safety concerns in student facilities  
- Ensure students know how to report wellbeing concerns confidentially  

#### Short‑term *(Environment & Experience)*
- Audit sanitation standards in student toilets and common areas  
- Review canteen food variety and student satisfaction  
- Address congestion during breaks through space reallocation  

#### Strategic *(Culture & Systems)*
- Establish regular student wellbeing check‑ins  
- Create clearer pathways for students to seek help early  
- Embed wellbeing indicators into ongoing school monitoring  

Each action line must:
- name the lived issue  
- avoid blame  
- imply ownership  

---

## 5️⃣ “Why This Matters” — MODULE Version (Not Executive)

This is **not** executive framing.

At module level, this line answers:

> **“Why should *this role* care?”**

### Example (Student Wellbeing):

**Why this matters:**  
Daily environmental and emotional stressors directly affect students’ sense of dignity, safety, and trust in the school.

Short. Quiet. Undeniable.

---

## 🧠 What NOT to Include at Module Level (Yet)

This restraint is intentional.

🚫 Cross‑stakeholder comparison  
🚫 Board‑safe language  
🚫 Financial or reputational framing  
🚫 Over‑aggregation  

Those belong **later**.

At module level, the dashboard should feel like:

> **“I finally see what life is like in this part of the school.”**

---

## 🧩 How This Scales Beautifully (Hidden Advantage)

Because every module follows the **same internal logic**, you automatically get:

- Student Wellbeing dashboard  
- Teacher Climate dashboard  
- Parent Experience dashboard  

⬇️ which roll up cleanly into:

- **Triangulation dashboard** *(where lenses collide)*  
- **Executive dashboard** *(where institutional risk is prioritised)*  

This is architecture‑level clarity, not UI decoration.
