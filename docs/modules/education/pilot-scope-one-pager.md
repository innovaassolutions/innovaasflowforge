# FlowForge for Schools: 14-Day Executive Leadership Pilot

> One-Page Overview for School Leadership

---

## What This Is

A 14-day institutional intelligence exercise that gives leadership early visibility into confidence, alignment, and strain — quietly, safely, and before it becomes reputational.

**This is not a survey. This is assurance.**

---

## What's Included

### Three Focused Modules

| Module | What It Reveals |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Student Wellbeing & Academic Life** | How students actually experience school — beyond what they say in assemblies |
| **Teaching & Learning Experience** | Where structural strain exists — before it becomes resignations |
| **Parent Confidence & Trust** | Whether confidence is strengthening or quietly eroding |

### Sampled Participation

| Group | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| Leadership / SLT | Full participation |
| Teachers | Selected sample |
| Parents | Selected sample |
| Students | Selected sample (age-appropriate) |

**Not whole-school. Purposeful. Contained.**

---

## How It Works

| Phase | Days | What Happens |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **Alignment** | 0-1 | We confirm scope, cohorts, and purpose with leadership |
| **Collection** | 2-10 | Participants complete asynchronous AI-facilitated conversations |
| **Synthesis** | 11-13 | We analyse patterns across all three stakeholder groups |
| **Readout** | 14 | 60-120 minute facilitated leadership conversation |

**No dashboards during collection. No reminder spam. Silence = seriousness.**

---

## What You Receive on Day 14

A facilitated leadership conversation that walks you through:

- What's holding
- What's slipping
- What's misunderstood
- What's at risk next term

**Not raw data. Interpreted intelligence.**

You control what leaves the room.

---

## How Anonymity Works

| Element | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Access | School-issued codes (no login required) |
| Identity | Pseudonymous tokens only (no names stored) |
| Mapping | School holds token→identity mapping (not FlowForge) |
| Safeguarding | Break-glass protocol for duty of care |

**We see patterns. You see patterns. No one sees names.**

---

## What This Is NOT

- Not an evaluation of leadership
- Not a parent satisfaction survey
- Not a staff performance review
- Not published or shared externally

**This is an instrument FOR your leadership, not an assessment OF it.**

---

## Investment

| School Tier | Pilot Fee |
|-------------|-----------|
| Tier A (1500+ students) | Contact for pricing |
| Tier B (500-1500 students) | Contact for pricing |

**Paid pilot. Because clarity has value.**

---

## What Happens After

No pressure. If the pilot reveals value, most schools choose to:

- Extend visibility to additional modules
- Unlock Situational Intelligence (leadership transitions, open days, change impact)
- Move to annual institutional intelligence subscription

**Progression, not pressure.**

## The Question This Answers

> "What feels stable from the top often feels fragile from the middle."

FlowForge lets you see that fragility early — without announcing a crisis, without naming individuals, without forcing action before you're ready.
