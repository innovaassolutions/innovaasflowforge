# FlowForge Education: School Communication Templates

> Exact language for introducing FlowForge to each stakeholder group
> Generated: 2025-12-29

---

## Purpose

These templates provide schools with precise language for introducing the FlowForge pilot to students, teachers, and parents. The language has been designed to unlock honest participation while avoiding phrases that trigger self-censorship.

**Critical Principle:** Language matters more than UX. The wrong phrase collapses trust instantly.

---

## Part 1: Student Communication

### Context
Students are attuned to power, surveillance, and consequences. They default to cautious, not excited. Trust must be earned, not stated.

Subject: Your Voice Matters — Anonymous Feedback Opportunity

Dear Students,

We are running a short exercise to better understand your daily experience at school.

Here's what you need to know:

**This is anonymised.**
- We cannot see who said what
- Your responses are not linked to your name, email, or student ID
- Teachers will not see individual responses
- This has nothing to do with grades, behaviour records, or references

**We are looking for patterns, not people.**
- We want to understand what's working and what isn't
- We're not trying to identify anyone
- Your honesty helps us improve

**How to participate:**
- Use your personal access code: [CODE]
- Complete the conversation in your own time
- Takes approximately 15-20 minutes

**Why we're doing this:**
Some of what we learn may be hard to hear. That's the point. We're trying to understand your experience — not to catch anyone, but to make things better.

Your access code expires on [DATE].

Thank you for helping us see what we might be missing.

[Signed by Head of School]

### Language That Works (Students)

| Use | Because |
|-----|---------|
| "Anonymised" | Clear, technical, believable |
| "Patterns, not people" | Removes fear of being identified |
| "Nothing to do with grades" | Explicit consequence firewall |
| "Some of this may be hard to hear" | Shows adult humility |
| "What we might be missing" | Admits imperfection |

### Language to AVOID (Students)

| Never Use | Because |
|-----------|---------|
| "Confidential" | Implies traceability |
| "Monitored" | Surveillance language |
| "Appropriate responses" | Signals filtering expected |
| "This will be reviewed carefully" | Triggers fear |
| "We take this seriously" (vague) | Empty promise |

## Part 2: Teacher Communication

### Context
Teachers calculate risk. Nothing is neutral when contracts are renewable. They need to believe this won't be weaponised against them.

### Template: Teacher Introduction Message

```
Subject: Institutional Intelligence Exercise — Staff Participation

Dear Colleagues,

We are participating in a 14-day institutional intelligence exercise to understand patterns across our school community.

**What this is:**
- An anonymous exercise to surface structural patterns
- Designed to reveal system-level insights, not individual performance
- Your responses are not linked to your name or identity
- Leadership sees aggregated patterns, not individual responses

**What this is NOT:**
- This is not a staff evaluation
- This is not an HR tool
- This will not influence contract decisions
- Workload patterns will not be used to justify "efficiency" measures

**We're looking for structural strain, not individual capacity.**

**How to participate:**
- Use your personal access code: [CODE]
- Complete the conversation in your own time
- Takes approximately 20-25 minutes

**Why we're doing this:**
Leadership intent doesn't always match lived reality. We're trying to understand the terrain — not defend decisions. Some of what we learn may be uncomfortable. That's why we're asking.

This is not about evaluating staff or leadership. It is about seeing patterns that no single role can see alone.

Your access code expires on [DATE].

### Language That Works (Teachers)

| Use | Because |
|-----|---------|
| "Structural strain, not individual capacity" | Removes performance fear |
| "System-level insights" | Depersonalises |
| "Not an HR tool" | Explicit firewall |
| "Understand the terrain — not defend decisions" | Shows openness |
| "Patterns no single role can see" | Frames as collaborative intelligence |

### Language to AVOID (Teachers)

| Never Use | Because |
|-----------|---------|
| "Feedback on leadership" | Triggers self-protection |
| "Staff collaboration issues" | Person-focused, not system-focused |
| "We'll take this seriously" | Vague, triggers suspicion |
| "Confidential" | Implies traceability |
| Introduced by Head of Department | Should come from Head of School |

### Timing Consideration

**Never launch near contract renewal periods.** Teachers will self-censor regardless of language.

## Part 3: Parent Communication

### Context
Parents are evaluating whether to trust. They're paying $30-50k+ and are highly attuned to whether the school can handle uncomfortable truths. They respond to seriousness, not marketing.

### Template: Parent Introduction Message

```
Subject: Understanding Your Experience — Parent Participation Invited

Dear Parents,

We are conducting a 14-day institutional intelligence exercise to understand how our school community is experiencing [School Name].

**What this is:**
- An anonymous opportunity to share your observations
- Designed to surface early signals, not collect endorsements
- Your responses are not linked to your name or your child
- Leadership sees patterns, not individual parent identities

**What this is NOT:**
- This is not a feedback form
- This is not a satisfaction survey
- Your comments will not affect how your child is treated
- This will not be used in marketing materials

**We are not looking for endorsement. We are looking for early signals.**

**How to participate:**
- Use your personal access code: [CODE]
- Complete the conversation in your own time
- Takes approximately 15-20 minutes

**Why we're doing this:**
We want to understand whether confidence in the school is strengthening or eroding — before families feel the need to act. Some of what we learn may require reflection on our part. That's the point.

This is not a feedback request. It is a way for us to understand what we might not be seeing.

Your access code expires on [DATE].

```

### Language That Works (Parents)

| Use | Because |
|-----|---------|
| "Early signals, not endorsements" | Serious, not marketing |
| "Strengthening or eroding" | Acknowledges possibility of problems |
| "Before families feel the need to act" | Shows awareness of withdrawal risk |
| "Require reflection on our part" | Demonstrates maturity |
| "What we might not be seeing" | Admits blind spots |

### Language to AVOID (Parents)

| Never Use | Because |
|-----------|---------|
| "We value your feedback" | Marketing language |
| "Help us serve you better" | Transactional, insincere |
| Overly polished tone | Triggers suspicion |
| Excessive reassurance | Looks like hiding something |
| "Confidential" | Implies traceability |

## Part 4: Leadership/SLT Communication

### Template: Leadership Team Briefing

```
Subject: FlowForge Pilot — Leadership Participation

Dear Leadership Team,

As you know, we are conducting a 14-day institutional intelligence pilot with FlowForge. As members of the Senior Leadership Team, your participation is essential.

**Your role:**
- Complete the leadership perspective conversation
- Use your personal access code: [CODE]
- Takes approximately 25-30 minutes

**What we're exploring:**
- How leadership intent lands across the school community
- Where there may be gaps between our perception and lived reality
- Patterns of alignment and strain we may not currently see

**What happens next:**
On Day 14, we will receive a facilitated readout of findings — interpreted, contextualised, and prioritised. Nothing raw. Nothing leaves the room unless we choose.

This exercise is not about evaluating us. It's about giving us visibility we don't currently have.

[Signed by Head of School]
```

## Part 5: Introduction Session Guidelines

### Who Should Introduce (And Who Should NOT)

| Stakeholder | Introduced By | NOT By |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Students | Head of School or Deputy | Classroom teachers |
| Teachers | Head of School | Heads of Department |
| Parents | Head of School | Admissions or Marketing |
| Leadership | Head of School | External consultant |

**Rationale:** Introduction by immediate supervisors (HoD for teachers, classroom teacher for students) triggers self-censorship. Leadership ownership signals seriousness.

### In-Person Introduction Script (All Groups)

```
"We're participating in a 14-day exercise to understand patterns
across our school community.

This is anonymised. We cannot see who said what.
We're looking for patterns, not people.

That's why we're doing this.

Your access code will be sent to you today.
Please complete the conversation within the next [X] days.

Thank you for helping us see what we might be missing."
```

### What NOT to Say in Introduction

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| "This is really important to us" | Sounds performative |
| "We promise to act on this" | Over-promising triggers cynicism |
| "Please be honest" | Implies you expect dishonesty |
| "Use appropriate language" | Signals filtering expected |
| "We'll be reading these carefully" | Surveillance implication |
