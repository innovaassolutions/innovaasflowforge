```

### Conference Approach

```
1. Attend EARCOS, FOBISIA, CIS conferences
2. Participate in leadership conversations
3. Share perspective (not product)
4. Follow up with interested leaders
5. Relationship-first, pilot-second
```

### Content Approach

```
1. Publish thought leadership on institutional intelligence
2. Share anonymised insights (with permission)

4. Inbound interest from aligned leaders
```
