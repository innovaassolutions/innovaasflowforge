Before you look at your results, here is the most important thing to understand:

This assessment does not measure your personality, potential, or leadership ability.  
It identifies **patterns** in how capable leaders adapt when pressure increases.

**Why You See Two Archetypes**

Your results include two leadership archetypes because most leaders do not lead the same way in all conditions.

**Your Default Archetype Under Pressure** 
 
This reflects what you instinctively rely on when things feel tense, overloaded, or high-stakes. It is a learned, protective response that developed because it worked. This archetype is not a flaw. It is often the reason you are trusted. Over time, though, leaning on it too heavily can become exhausting.

**Your Authentic Archetype When Grounded** 
 
This reflects how leadership feels when you are steady, supported, and not operating in constant reaction mode. It points to the style of leadership that feels more natural, sustainable, and energizing for you. This is not something you need to become. It is usually already present, but harder to access under pressure.

**What the Pairing Means**

For many leaders, these two archetypes are different. That does not mean anything is wrong. It usually means you are coping effectively, but not sustainably.

The pairing highlights where energy is being spent unnecessarily and where leadership may be working harder than it needs to.

**How to Approach Your Results**

As you review what follows:

- Treat these as patterns, not labels – the names are to put language on the pattern. 
- Look for resonance, not precision – we are all a mix of all of these archetypes. The goal here is to describe usual patterns not one-offs. 

The value is not in the category itself, but in what it helps you notice. After you read your results, I will share some next steps.
