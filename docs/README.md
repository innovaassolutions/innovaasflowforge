## Key Architecture Decisions

### Multi-Agent AI System
Each stakeholder role engages with a specialized AI agent that adapts its questioning based on:
- Stakeholder role and responsibilities
- Previous responses and context
- Assessment objectives
- Conversation phase

### Token-Based Access
Stakeholders access their interview sessions via unique, cryptographically secure tokens:
- No password required
- Single-use per stakeholder
- Secure session isolation
- Time-unlimited access (sessions can be paused and resumed)

### Campaign-Centric Design
All assessments are organized as campaigns:
- Multiple stakeholders per campaign
- Facilitator-managed
- Company-specific context
- Progress tracking across all participants

### Synthesis-First Analytics
The platform is designed to:
1. Capture multi-perspective inputs
2. Identify patterns and gaps across stakeholders
3. Synthesize strategic insights automatically
4. Generate actionable recommendations
