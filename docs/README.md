## Key Architecture Decisions

### Multi-Agent AI System
Each stakeholder role engages with a specialized AI agent that adapts its questioning based on:
- Stakeholder role and responsibilities
- Previous responses and context
- Assessment objectives
- Conversation phase

### Token-Based Access
Stakeholders access their interview sessions via unique, cryptographically secure tokens:
- No password required
- Single-use per stakeholder
- Secure session isolation
- Time-unlimited access (sessions can be paused and resumed)

### Campaign-Centric Design
All assessments are organized as campaigns:
- Multiple stakeholders per campaign
- Facilitator-managed
- Company-specific context
- Progress tracking across all participants

### Synthesis-First Analytics
The platform is designed to:
1. Capture multi-perspective inputs
2. Identify patterns and gaps across stakeholders
3. Synthesize strategic insights automatically
4. Generate actionable recommendations

---

## Deployment Architecture

### FlowForge Proxy Setup

FlowForge is deployed as a **separate application** that appears seamlessly integrated into the main Innovaas website through Next.js rewrites (proxy, not redirect).

#### Two Separate Applications

1. **Main Website** (`www.innovaas.co`)
   - Repository: `innovaasWebsite`
   - Vercel deployment of main company site
   - Configured with rewrites to proxy `/flowforge` requests

2. **FlowForge App** (`https://innovaasflowforge.vercel.app`)
   - Repository: `innovaasflowforge` (this project)
   - Separate Vercel deployment
   - Independent Next.js application
   - Configured with `basePath: '/flowforge'`

#### How the Proxy Works

**Main Website Configuration** (`next.config.js`):
```javascript
async rewrites() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/flowforge',
      destination: 'https://innovaasflowforge.vercel.app/flowforge',
    },
    {
      source: '/flowforge/:path*',
      destination: 'https://innovaasflowforge.vercel.app/flowforge/:path*',
    },
  ];
}
```

**FlowForge App Configuration** (`next.config.js`):
```javascript
basePath: '/flowforge'
```

#### Request Flow

1. User visits: `www.innovaas.co/flowforge`
2. Main website's Next.js matches the rewrite rule
3. Request is **proxied** (not redirected) to `https://innovaasflowforge.vercel.app/flowforge`
4. FlowForge serves the page (basePath configured)
5. Static assets load correctly via same proxy mechanism
6. **User sees**: `www.innovaas.co/flowforge` in browser (seamless single-domain experience)

#### Important Development Notes

- **All API routes** in FlowForge require `/flowforge` prefix via the `apiUrl()` helper function
- **Static assets** automatically handled by `basePath` configuration
- **No redirects** = Better UX and single domain experience
- **Testing locally**: Run FlowForge on its own without basePath, deploy to Vercel with basePath enabled

#### The `apiUrl` Helper

Located in `lib/api-url.ts`, this helper ensures all API calls work correctly under the `/flowforge` basePath:

```typescript
export function apiUrl(path: string): string {
  const basePath = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH || ''
  const cleanPath = path.startsWith('/') ? path : `/${path}`
  return `${basePath}${cleanPath}`
}
```

Usage in components:
```typescript
const response = await fetch(apiUrl('api/campaigns'))
// Resolves to: /flowforge/api/campaigns in production
// Resolves to: /api/campaigns in local development
```
