Pricing interviewer agents well is **not about token costs or “AI usage”** — it’s about **monetizing avoided human effort, risk reduction, and decision quality**.

Below is a **practical, enterprise-realistic pricing framework**, tailored to consulting, manufacturing discovery, and transformation work (exactly your lane).

---

## First Principle (Anchor This)

> **You are not selling an AI. You are selling discovery outcomes.**

Clients don’t buy:

* Interviews
* Transcripts
* Tokens

They buy:

* Faster clarity
* Fewer wrong decisions
* Less consultant time
* Better executive confidence

---

## Step 1: Define the Unit of Value (Very Important)

Avoid pricing per “agent” or per “model.”

Instead, price by **business unit of discovery**:

### Strong Units of Value

* **Discovery engagement**
* **Assessment**
* **Interview pack**
* **System audit**
* **Transformation baseline**

Example:

> “Operational Discovery for 1 factory”
> “Digital Readiness Assessment for 1 business unit”

This keeps you **out of the commodity AI trap**.

---

## Step 2: Tiered Outcome-Based Pricing (Recommended)

### Tier 1 — Baseline Discovery

**$3k–$7k per engagement**

**Includes**

* 5–10 structured interviews
* Core system inventory
* Pain points + risks
* High-level opportunity map

**Client mindset**

> “This replaces 1–2 weeks of consultant discovery.”

---

### Tier 2 — Deep Diagnostic (Most Profitable)

**$10k–$25k per engagement**

**Includes**

* 15–30 interviews (multi-role)
* Cross-role contradiction analysis
* Process + data flow mapping
* AI-readiness or digital maturity score
* Executive-ready summary

This directly competes with **Big 4 / McKinsey light engagements**.

---

### Tier 3 — Transformation-Ready Intelligence

**$30k–$75k+**

**Includes**

* Continuous interviewer agent access
* Follow-up interviews over time
* Assumption tracking
* Scenario and impact modeling
* Roadmap input into ERP / MES / AI programs

This becomes **infrastructure**, not a one-off.

---

## Step 3: Subscription vs Engagement (Hybrid Wins)

### One-Off Engagement (Entry Point)

* Easy sell
* Budget-friendly
* Clear ROI

### Ongoing Subscription (Where Scale Happens)

**Example**

* $2k–$5k/month per org unit
* Unlimited interviews
* Living knowledge base
* Re-interview when systems change
* Continuous readiness tracking

You position this as:

> “Always-on organizational memory.”

This aligns perfectly with:

* SAP rollouts
* Multi-site manufacturing
* Leadership turnover risk

---

## Step 4: Cost Framing (Do This Explicitly)

Help the client justify the spend:

> “This replaces:
>
> * 3 consultants × 2 weeks
> * Multiple workshops
> * Inconsistent notes
> * Follow-up clarification cycles”

Even conservative math shows:

* $25k AI discovery vs $150k consulting discovery

You don’t need to say “AI” much at all.

---

## Step 5: Add-On Pricing (High Margin)

### Premium Add-Ons

* Executive-only interviewer persona
* Regulatory / audit-specific interview trees
* Industry-specific benchmarks
* Second-pass “challenge” agent
* Human-in-the-loop validation sessions

These are **value multipliers**, not token multipliers.

---

## Step 6: Internal Cost Control (Your Side)

Since you’re sensitive to LLM pricing:

### Techniques

* Use cheaper models for question flow
* Expensive models only for synthesis
* Cache answers
* Reuse interview trees
* Trigger deep analysis only when contradictions appear

This keeps gross margins strong without touching list price.

---

## Step 7: Positioning Language (Critical)

Avoid ❌

> “AI interviewer bot”

Use ✅

* “Automated Discovery Platform”
* “Intelligent Assessment Engine”
* “Continuous Organizational Insight”
* “Decision-Grade Discovery”

Executives buy **confidence**, not bots.

---

## Example Pitch (You Can Reuse This)

> “We deploy an intelligent discovery system that interviews your stakeholders, identifies blind spots and contradictions, and produces an executive-grade assessment in days instead of weeks.
>
> It’s priced per assessment, not per user, because the value is in the outcome.”

That lands well in boardrooms.

---

## Strategic Insight (The Real Moat)

> **Your differentiation isn’t the interviewer agent — it’s the interview design.**

Anyone can spin up an LLM.
Very few can:

* Ask the right questions
* Detect bullshit politely
* Convert chaos into decision-ready insight

That’s what clients will pay for.

* Build a **pricing page mock**
* Create **3 packaged offers** for manufacturing
* Help you script **objection handling** (“Why not just use ChatGPT?”)

Just tell me where you want to go next.
