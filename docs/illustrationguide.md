# Character Illustration Style Guide Prompt

## Core Visual Style

Create illustrations in a charming, hand-drawn editorial style with the following characteristics:

**Line Work:** Use bold, charcoal/dark gray ink-style outlines with a slightly sketchy, organic quality. Lines should have subtle texture and variation in weight—thicker for body masses and contours, thinner for details. Allow for small imperfections and wobbles that give the drawings warmth and personality.

**Color Palette:** Strictly monochromatic using only charcoal gray (primary line work and solid fills) against a transparent background. No accent colors, no gradients, no additional tones.

**Texture:** Use light hatching or stippling to suggest shading and dimension, particularly on rounded forms. Maintain the hand-drawn, slightly rough quality throughout.

**Character Proportions:** Figures should be stylized with oversized heads (approximately 1/3 of body height), simplified geometric body shapes, and expressive but minimal facial features. Bodies are chunky and endearing—think friendly editorial illustration rather than anatomical accuracy.

**Faces:** Simple and expressive—small curved lines for closed, content eyes; basic nose shapes; minimal or no mouths. Hair should be rendered with flowing, decorative line patterns.

**Clothing:** Use horizontal stripes on shirts as a recurring motif. Clothing is simplified into bold shapes with minimal interior detail.

**Poses:** Dynamic, exaggerated poses that convey action and emotion. Figures should feel active and engaged, with sweeping arm gestures and slight forward leans.

**Props & Objects:** Oversized relative to figures for visual impact. Rendered with the same bold outline style and minimal interior detail.

**Background:** Fully transparent. Include simple ground shadow beneath figures (hatched oval shape in charcoal).

## Character Set 1: Chemist (Pharmaceutical Manufacturing)

Create a character wearing a lab coat over a striped shirt, with safety goggles pushed up on their head or around their neck, and their hair in a practical style. They should have a friendly, focused demeanor.

**Activity Variations:**

1. **Holding up a flask or beaker** with one hand, examining the contents with a satisfied expression. Liquid inside rendered as a simple shape. Small motion lines near the flask suggesting it was just lifted.

2. **hodling a tablet**—standing at a stylized centrifuge or reactor vessel, one hand on controls, body leaning in with concentration. Equipment should be simplified into bold geometric shapes.

3. **Reviewing data with a colleague**—two figures, one holding a clipboard or tablet, the other gesturing toward it. Both in lab coats, one with curly hair, one with straight. Collaborative, engaged poses.

4. **Carrying a rack of test tubes** (oversized) while walking purposefully. The rack should be comically large. Include small lines suggesting careful movement.

## Character Set 2: Teacher

Create a character with expressive, flowing hair, wearing casual professional attire (striped top, simple pants or skirt). They should radiate warmth and enthusiasm.

**Activity Variations:**

1. **Drawing on a whiteboard or chalkboard**—reaching up with one arm to draw a large heart or simple diagram. Board rendered as a simple rectangle. Include a large pencil or marker as a secondary element.

2. **Reading from an oversized book** held open with both hands, head tilted down slightly, peaceful expression. Book should be exaggeratedly large.

3. **Gesturing enthusiastically while explaining**—arms wide, one hand raised with index finger pointing up in an "aha" moment. Small motion lines radiating from the gesture.

4. **Helping a smaller figure (student)**—bending down or kneeling next to a smaller character, both looking at the same object (book, paper, or device). Warm, nurturing body language.

## Character Set 3: Consultant

Create a character with a neat, professional appearance—collared shirt or sweater, carrying business accessories. Confident, purposeful energy.

**Activity Variations:**

1. **Presenting with a laptop**—holding an open laptop in one hand while gesturing with the other, body angled toward an implied audience. Laptop rendered as a simple open rectangle.

2. **On a phone call while reviewing documents**—one hand holding a corded or mobile phone to ear, other hand holding papers or tablet. Multitasking energy, slight forward lean.

3. **Shaking hands with a client figure**—two characters in professional attire, hands clasped in the center, both with pleased expressions. Equal sizing to suggest partnership.

4. **Carrying an oversized briefcase or bag** bulging with documents, walking with purpose. Papers slightly sticking out the top. Motion lines suggesting brisk pace. Confident stride.

## Character Set 4: Industrial Worker (Manufacturing Setting)

Create a character wearing a hard hat or beanie, safety vest or work coveralls over a striped undershirt, sturdy boots. Capable, hands-on energy.

**Activity Variations:**

1. **Lifting/carrying an oversized sack or container**—one arm raised high holding a bulging bag, body showing the effort but also capability. Small effort lines near the lifted weight.

2. **Operating machinery**—hands on controls of a stylized machine (conveyor, crane lever, control panel). Focused expression, protective eyewear.

3. **Inspecting equipment with a clipboard**—one hand holding clipboard, other hand touching or pointing to a large machine element. Analytical pose.

4. **Trimming/maintaining equipment**—using oversized shears, wrench, or tool on a large mechanical or organic element. Active cutting/adjusting motion with small debris particles flying.
