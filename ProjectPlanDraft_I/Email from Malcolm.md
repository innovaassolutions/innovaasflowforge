Good Afternoon Todd,

I trust you’re well today 

Great to meet with you and thank you for coming over to site 2

As discussed please could you arrange to meet with Waqas next week, I would like your review and feedback on our current setup, the good, the bad and the ugly;

### Site 1 IIoT setup

1. Architecture
2. Autocount / Alumetrics (how we move forward without freely) Digitisation 
3. Automation of Data and Data input 
	1. Use insights from digital and AI data to identify inefficiencies and automate processes accordingly

4. AI integration for decision making and document processing 
	1. Collect historical and real-time data to enable learning, trend analysis, and predictive decision making.

### Site 2 IIoT setup

1. Currently a blank canvas, taking your review and learning from site 1 what should we transfer over to site 2
2. Architecture / Machine connectivity
3. We will use Autocount, Where should we start next
4. Automation of data and data input
	1. Use insights from digital and AI data to identify inefficiencies and automate processes accordingly

5. AI Integration for decision making and document processing
	1. Collect historical and real-time data to enable learning, trend analysis, and predictive decision making.

The aim of the exercise is to have an object outside opinion, I want to ensure we have a handle on the critical elements and are strategically heading in the right direction 

I very much look forward to you feedback and confirmation of when you can visit us next week 

If you have any questions or need anything further please let me know

Thank you and have a great day
